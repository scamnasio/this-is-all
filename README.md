# This Is All You Need
This is a project exploring the boundaries of privacy, personal information, and identity in the modern era. What is the minimum amount of information needed in order to have enough to virtually "track" a person's whereabouts?
We seek to define the minimum amount of features in a face which, in combination with public social media profile information (name & location), represent the entire identity of a person.

This project is in active development.
